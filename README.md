# Examples-R

I have worked with R on a number of occasions since 2015, when I first learned it for a data analysis class, and have used it in my own analysis for both work-related and extracurricular projects. Although I'm unable for confidentiality reasons (using Personally Identifiable Information) to show off work projects, I figured the school and fun stuff would be a good way to showcase my proficiency in data pre-processing and statistical analysis.

This repository includes the following folders and items:
1. School R Files
  1. Assignment 4
    * This assignment utilized the publically-available National Health Interview Survey data from the last ten years as of creation of the file. The study was an attempt to determine whether there was a statistically significant correlation between vigorous exercise over 10 minutes and a feeling of restlessness, as reported by subjects delineated by sex, gender, age, and region of residence.
  2. Assignment 5
    * The two authors of a survey pertaining to food taste and spoons (http://www.flavourjournal.com/content/2/1/21), Vanessa Harar and Charles Spence, were kind enough to share their data with our class. From this data, we were asked to determine veracity of statistical claims as to the difference in taste between type of cutlery, the density of the cutlery, and the saltiness of the yogurt.
  3. Assignment 6
    * This is a version in R of a project also attempted in Python (see Examples-py), attempting to extract data from a directory, deformatting it, and finding the term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency for each word of the corpus.

2. School data
  * This is the location for all the data necessary to run and check the files in the School R Files folder. The R files will list every file necessary to run the script at the top of each script.
  
3. Extracurricular Projects
  1. Double X Files
    * My friend Alison does a (NSFW) podcast with their friend Courtney about the X Files, and primarily how they do not like the X Files. At the end of (almost) every episode, they rank the episode on a scale of "spookiness" and the amount of rage that the episode produces in them. They also predict the story and contents of the next episode, as a friendly ccompetition. As a joke, the two asked their listeners to track these stats, and as a joke, I did. Included is both the data for each episode and the script used to measure the relationship between each episode and their rankings. Of note--the rage scale is a fairly reliable example of a bimodal distribution, suggesting that Alison is predisposed to give certain ratings over others in contrast to a regular bell curve distribution.
